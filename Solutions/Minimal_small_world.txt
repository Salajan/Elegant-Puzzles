The first idea is to consider the pages as the nodes of a binary tree (oriented 
starting from the root). We can go from the root to any other node in 9 clicks and we 
still have the leaves available to connect. 

The second idea is to continue to connect the leaves such that the binary tree becomes
cyclical (kind of). The first leaf connects to the first and second node, the second
leaf connects with the third and fourth etc. (in the depth-first search order). Notice
this actually works: from each vertex, after k steps we reach 2**k consecutive
vertices (in the depth first search order and cyclically).So after 10 steps we can
reach 1024 consecutive vertices (in particular all the 1000 distinct vertices).

Formally, we can also index the pages 1,2,...,1000 and connect each x to 2*x and 2*x+1 
mod 1000. After 10 steps we reach 1024*x, 1024*x+1,..., 1024*x + 1023 (mod 1000) which
contain all 1000 pages.
